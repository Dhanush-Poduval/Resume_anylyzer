            "What is Decentralization?\n",
            "Decentralization is the process of shifting power and responsibilities from central or  \n",
            "state governments to local self-government institutions. It allows for more public \n",

            "The Panchayati Raj system in India is a three-tier structure:1. Gram Panchayat – \n",
            "village level2. Panchayat Samiti – block level3. Zilla Parishad – district levelThe \n",

            "Kerala’s Approach\n",
            "Kerala took decentralization further through initiatives like the People’s Plan \n",
            "Campaign, started in 1996. It aimed to directly involve people in development \n",
            "planning. Kerala also allocates around 35–40% of its plan funds to local bodies, \n",

            "and delivery of services.\n",
            "Why It Worked in Kerala\n",
            "- Strong political will: The state leadership supported decentralization from the \n",
            "beginning.- High literacy rate: Educated citizens participated more actively in local \n",
            "governance.- Civil society involvement: NGOs and community groups helped raise \n",

            "trained to manage planning, budgeting, and implementation of schemes.- \n",
            "Technology use: Digital platforms helped track development projects and budgets.\n",
            "Impact\n",
            "The Panchayati Raj system brought many positive changes in Kerala:- Access to \n",
            "healthcare, clean drinking water, and education improved.- Governance became \n",
            "more transparent and corruption reduced.- Marginalized groups got a stronger voice  \n",

            "public health outperformed national averages.\n",
            "Challenges\n",
            "Despite the success, some challenges still exist:- Many Panchayats depend heavily on  \n",
            "state funds and lack independent revenue sources.- There is still a shortage of \n",

            "caste and class discrimination continue in some areas.- Coordination between \n",

            "of India. Its success shows that when people are educated, involved, and \n",
